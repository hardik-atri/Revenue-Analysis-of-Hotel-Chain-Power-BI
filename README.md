- Built a Interactive Dashboard using Power BI to analyze the Revenue of a Hotel Chain.
- Started with Key Performance like:
-   * Revenue
-   * Occpancy %
-   * RevPAR : RevPAR represents the revenue generated per available room, whether or not they are occupied. RevPAR helps hotels measure their revenue generating performance to accurately price rooms. RevPAR can help hotels measure themselves against other properties or brands. = Revenue / Total Capacity
-   * Cancellation %
-   * Avg. Rating


-Then in Level 2 analysis : We analyzed Revenue , Occupancy % and RevPAR by City.

-Then in Level 3 analysis : We analyzed Booking by Platform and Occupancy % between Weekdays and Weekends ( Friday and Saturday are considered as weekends )

- We analyzed weekly revenue trend and also plotted a table with Hotel type and their different metrics.
